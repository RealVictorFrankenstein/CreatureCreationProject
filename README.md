	Victor Frankenstein, the central character in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," possesses a profound and intricate personality. Fueled by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and recognition, he became consumed by his studies, driven by the ambition to make groundbreaking scientific discoveries. To convey this complexity, I created a GitHub profile that reflects his relentless pursuit of scientific glory. In this essay, we will delve into Victor's primary goals, his nature, and why GitHub serves as an ideal medium to encapsulate his character. 

Victor Frankenstein is a broken man who has a void in his life that he needs to fill. His primary characteristics are his insatiable thirst for knowledge and power. This thirst for knowledge is at the heart of the story. His goal was to uncover the 'secret of life' to bring the living from inanimate objects. He accomplished this goal but was tainted by his arrogance, obsession, and shortsightedness. His unwavering focus on completing the monster and proving himself a worthy man blinded him to the potential consequences of his actions. This is why I chose to include the 'laws.cpp' program, which does not function correctly and is plagued by numerous bugs due to his haste and recklessness. Additionally, 'Training.cpp' contains no code, only comments, as Victor believed the monster would be perfect and not require any training, given that he was its creator. 

Victor is also an intensely secretive individual. He shares his experiment with no one and is determined to keep the horror he has created hidden from the world. An excerpt from the novel vividly illustrates his paranoia: “"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; "he can tell. — Oh, save me! save me!" I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and fell down in a fit.” (Volume 1, Chapter 4, Shelly) This excerpt reveals Victor's deep fear of others discovering the grotesque consequences of his actions. He cares primarily about self-preservation, which is why he hides away anything that does not cast him in a positive light. To represent his secretive nature, I encoded 'Brain.cpp' with a Vigenère cipher, with the key being 'Victor.' This symbolizes his need for power and self-centeredness, as he endeavors to maintain control over his creation and his secrets. 

The choice of GitHub as the platform for representing Victor Frankenstein is rooted in its unique ability to outline the creation of his monstrous experiment. Within the GitHub profile, I can depict steps of the process that bringing the creature to life would take, from the initialization of the monster's creation to the coding of the laws that govern its behavior. The stark absence of code in the training program 'Training.cpp' mirrors Victor's belief in the monster's inherent perfection, again reflecting his arrogance. GitHub's commit section allows Victor to document his thoughts and motivations, akin to the closed commit where he started creating the monster's companion but deemed it too risky to continue. In many ways, I envision the creature as a form of artificial intelligence gone wrong. 

In conclusion, Victor Frankenstein's character, depicted in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," is one of complexity, ambition, and secrecy. The GitHub profile representation provides an insightful lens through which to understand his character's intricacies. Through the analysis of his GitHub activities, we gain a deeper comprehension of Victor's insatiable thirst for knowledge and power with his unwavering determination to safeguard his secrets, even if it means creating a destructive force. It is a portrayal that not only captures his relentless ambition but also shows the theme of scientific hubris and its consequences. In many ways, Victor's creation on GitHub mirrors the very monstrosity he brought to life – a testament to the power of science and its unpredictable consequences.
